    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.</p>
    <p>The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished.</p>
    <p>But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.</p>
