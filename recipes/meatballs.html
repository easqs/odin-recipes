    <h1>Italian Meatballs</h1>
    <p>Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        </li><h5>&#9832; Step 1</h5>
        <p>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 2</h5>
        <p>Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 3</h5>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 4</h5>
        <p>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl (do not overmix). Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 5</h5>
        <p>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 6</h5>
        <p>Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet.</p></li>
        <li><h5>&#9832; Step 7</h5>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>Some recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe.
        <br><br>Once cooked, you can add the meatballs to your favorite prepared tomato sauce for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
